They will finish the point of the sales transaction each time they make a purchase. For the purpose of our case study. We created a mobile application using react-native in which the customer or user inputs the product or service or item name, price, quantity, and whether or not the item is discounted. Customers will use the cart button to add more products and information to the system. Finally, it calculates the total price to be paid for the merchandise, and clients push the Total button.
